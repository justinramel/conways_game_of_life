#Conway's Game of Life

My try at Conways game of life TTD kata:

My solution went a lot further than the "one step" described in the kata
because it was so much fun, I wanted to see the cells moving around the screen.

As well as an exercise in TDD I'm also working through the book 'Applying UML
and patterns' specifically the chapters on the GRASP's patterns which has lead
to a solution with lots of objects.
